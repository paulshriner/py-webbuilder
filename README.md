# py-webbuilder

A Markdown parser and static website builder using Python

## Overview

The idea of this project is to allow creating a static website through Markdown files, which are more approachable than raw HTML. It is built using Python, without using a library such as [Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) that would do much of the work. I got the idea from using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for static websites in the past, which also generates content through Markdown files. My goal is not to make something as fully-featured and production-ready as Hugo, but rather to use this to gain experience in Python and create a potentially useful project.

## Features

- Parse common Markdown syntax and generate corresponding HTML [In Progress]
- Create HTML documents based on template files from default theme or user-specified theme [In Progress]
- Use a configuration Markdown file for site-wide constants like the title in the header [Not Started]
- Have a CLI (GUI?) for setting options [Not Started]
- ...more as I develop the project!
